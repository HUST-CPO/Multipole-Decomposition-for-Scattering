# Multipole Decomposition for Scattering (MDS)

## Overview
The open-source Matlab package MDS is the numerical implementation of the multipole decomposition for arbitrary scattering objects, based on a combination of full-wave simulation and numerical projection. Our algorithm is capable of computing higher order multipole coefficients beyond dipole and quadrupole with decent efficiency.

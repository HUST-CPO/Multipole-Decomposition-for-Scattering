    %% COMP_NEXT computes the compositions of the integer N into K parts.
    %
    %  Discussion:
    %
    %    A composition of the integer N into K parts is an ordered sequence
    %    of K nonnegative integers which sum to N.  The compositions (1,2,1)
    %    and (1,1,2) are considered to be distinct.
    %
    %    The routine computes one composition on each call until there are no more.
    %    For instance, one composition of 6 into 3 parts is
    %    3+2+1, another would be 6+0+0.
    %
    %    On the first call to this routine, set MORE = FALSE.  The routine
    %    will compute the first element in the sequence of compositions, and
    %    return it, as well as setting MORE = TRUE.  If more compositions
    %    are desired, call again, and again.  Each time, the routine will
    %    return with a new composition.
    %
    %    However, when the LAST composition in the sequence is computed
    %    and returned, the routine will reset MORE to FALSE, signaling that
    %    the end of the sequence has been reached.
    %
    %    This routine originally used a SAVE statement to maintain the
    %    variables H and T.  I have decided that it is safer
    %    to pass these variables as arguments, even though the user should
    %    never alter them.  This allows this routine to safely shuffle
    %    between several ongoing calculations.
    %
    %    There are 28 compositions of 6 into three parts.  This routine will
    %    produce those compositions in the following order:
    %
    %     I         A
    %     -     ---------
    %     1     6   0   0
    %     2     5   1   0
    %     3     4   2   0
    %     4     3   3   0
    %     5     2   4   0
    %     6     1   5   0
    %     7     0   6   0
    %     8     5   0   1
    %     9     4   1   1
    %    10     3   2   1
    %    11     2   3   1

    %    13     0   5   1
    %    14     4   0   2
    %    15     3   1   2
    %    16     2   2   2

    %
    %  Parameters:
    %
    %    Input, integer N, the integer whose compositions are desired.
    %
    %    Input, integer K, the number of parts in the composition.
    %
    %    Input, integer A(K), the previous composition.  On the first call,
    %    with MORE = FALSE, set A = [].  Thereafter, A should be the
    %    value of A output from the previous call.
    %
    %    Input, logical MORE.  The input value of MORE on the first
    %    call should be FALSE, which tells the program to initialize.
    %    On subsequent calls, MORE should be TRUE, or simply the
    %    output value of MORE from the previous call.
    %
    %    Input, integer H, T, two internal parameters needed for the
    %    computation.  The user may need to initialize these before the
    %    very first call, but these initial values are not important.
    %    The user should not alter these parameters once the computation
    %    begins.
    %
    %    Output, integer A(K), the next composition.
    %
    %    Output, logical MORE, will be TRUE unless the composition
    %    that is being returned is the final one in the sequence.
    %
    %    Output, integer H, T, the updated values of the two internal
    %    parameters.
